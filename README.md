## Hi there 👋

My name is Aditi Darade. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business from the University of Kansas. I am passionate about building modular apps and integrating multiple different 𝐂𝐒𝐒 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬 using 𝗔𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿, 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭, and 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭, as well as 𝐌𝐲𝐒𝐐𝐋 for connecting to backend databases. I am proficient in programming languages such as 𝐂++, 𝐂#, and 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧. My business minor has made me capable of solving complicated challenges with analytical thinking and thriving in a fast-paced environment.
